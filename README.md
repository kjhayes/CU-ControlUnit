# CU-ControlUnit

~ Archiving Message ~
I first made this project before I knew what a build system was. Since then I've found Make, CMake, and so many more systems which do what I was trying to do here much better, and without my dubious use of the std::system() function. It's a sentimental project for me, because looking back on it I came to the same problem that programmers long before I was born must have come across when Make was first written. But now, it's hopelessly worthless compared to the real world alternatives, so I'm archiving the repository.

- CU is an extremely simple application.
- CU makes undoubtedly unsafe use of the c++ std::system() function, so use at your own risk.
- Made to Run Win32 CMD Prompt commands based off of makefiles using a specified syntax. 
- Only meant for personal use, and not intended for others.
- Read "Syntax.txt" for an overview of the basic syntax to write CMD's
